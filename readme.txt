# This project sets out to:

Identify the most similar sequence in a dataset to an input sequence.

# It functions by:

1. Iteratively performing pairwise sequence analysis using Biopython, and choosing the highest scoring sequence.

2. Computing probabilities across dataset.

3. Reconstructing a phylogenetic tree with the dataset and input sequence.
