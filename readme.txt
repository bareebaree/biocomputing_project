# This project sets out to:

Identify the most similar sequence in a dataset to an input sequence.

# It functions by:

1. Iteratively performing pairwise sequence analysis using Biopython, and choosing the highest scoring sequence.

2. Computing probabilities across dataset.

3. Reconstructing a phylogenetic tree with the dataset and input sequence.

To run:

1. Download entire project folder 
2. Ensure python 3.12 is installed
3. ensure following libraries are installed:
  -BioPython
  -Matplotlib
  -Pytest
  -datetime
  -tqdm
